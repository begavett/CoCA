## General Instructions and Scoring Guidelines

The CoCA is made up of 20 items. Items have a total score and various process scores. Item scores are combined using a CFA model to arrive at the CoCA global z-score. There is an additional supplement to assist with scoring of process variables. Process variables are not reflected in the global score of the CoCA. Specific process variables are identified for items; the examiner can use the process variables supplement to indicate the presence and number of item-specific qualitative features.

In general, each correct response receives one point unless otherwise specified. Items that are not scored are indicated as such in this manual and their scoring sections are greyed out on the CoCA.

Examiners are encouraged not to affirm or respond to examinee’s responses. If the examinee makes a mistake, do not correct them, unless otherwise specified.

No additional materials besides a pen and a stopwatch are needed for the CoCA. All stimulus materials needed for administration of the CoCA are available as supplemental pages. Please try and record examinee’s responses verbatim as much as possible.

## 1. Prospective Memory Test

### Materials Needed

None

### Instructions

*Suppose you have to look at a bank statement in a little while. When I say that the test is over, I want you to remind me that you have to look a bank statement.*

### Scoring

This item is not scored

(If examinee reminds you about looking at bank statement after the shape trail test, restate instructions and emphasize that the reminder only has to occur when the examiner states that the test is over.)

## 2. Shape Trail Test

Adapted from [Zhao et al., 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057333)

    - Placement: in appropriate segment (upper half of bottom right quadrant)
  9. Ramparts
    - Accuracy

- Global
  - 1 point for every correct response including not responding when appropriate (for example, not responding when the examiner says aisle), for a maximum of 42 points

## 9. Clock Command 

### Materials Needed

[Supplement 4](https://github.com/begavett/CoCA/blob/master/Supplements/Supplement4.pdf)

### Scoring for Clock Copy and Command

- Global: Use scoring system below [(Rouleau et al., 1992)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0278-2626(92)90112-Y), for a maximum of 10 points for each (command and copy)
  - Integrity of the clock face (maximum: 2 points)
    - 2: Present without gross distortion
    - 1: Incomplete or some distortion
    - 0: Absent or totally inappropriate
  - Presence and sequencing of the numbers (maximum: 4 points)
    - 4: All present in the right order and at most minimal error in the spatial arrangement
    - 3: All present but errors in spatial arrangement
    - 2: Numbers missing or added but no gross distortions of the remaining numbers; numbers placed in counterclockwise direction; numbers all present but gross distortion in spatial layout (i.e., hemineglect, numbers outside the clock)
    - 1: Missing or added
    - 0: Absence or poor representation of numbers
  - Presence and placement of the hands (maximum: 4 points)
    - 4: Hands are in correct position and the size difference is respected.
    - 3: Slight errors in the placement of the hands or no representation of size difference between the hands.
    - 2: Major errors in the placement of the hands (significantly out of course including 10 to 11)
    - 1: Only one hand or poor representation of two hands
    - 0: No hands or perseveration on hands
- Process
  - Size of clock: small if its measures less than 1.5 inches and large if it measures more than 5 inches
  - Graphical errors: lines are not precise resulting in distortions of the clock face or making the numbers difficult to read. The hands are not straight and sometimes fail to connect in the middle. The overall performance appears inaccurate and clumsy. 
  - Stimulus-bound errors: hands are set for 10 to 11 instead of 10 past 11; time is written in numbers/letters besides 10 and/or 11 or between 10 and 11; hands are either absent or pointed to 10 and/or 11.
  - Conceptual errors: clock face without numbers or inappropriate use of numbers; time is misrepresented on the clock either by writing it on the clockface or the hands are absent or inadequately represented
  - Spatial/planning deficits: neglect of the left hemisphere; planning difficulties with inappropriate gap before 12 or 3, 6, or 9; disorganization in the layout of the numbers, numbers written outside the clockface, numbers written counter clockwise
  - Perseveration: presence of more than 2 hands; ongoing tracing of hands; ongoing prolongation of numbers; repetition of numbers

    - Subordinate response: provision of responses that relate to shared concrete traits (e.g., orange - banana: they have skin) or specific properties about the items that may not be correct in all instances (e.g., boat-car: they have motors)
  - Out of set errors
    - One object response: provision of a response that only addresses one word from the pair (e.g., train-bicycle: one is faster than the other)
    - Juxtaposition responses: provision of a response that describes the interaction of one member of the word pair with the other (e.g., cat-mouse: the cat can eat the mouse)
    - Different responses: provision of a response that accurately describes how the two words of the pair are different (e.g., tongue-nose: you smell with your nose and taste with your tongue).

## 12. Number Symbol Matching Test

### Materials Needed

Supplements [6A (Written)](https://github.com/begavett/CoCA/blob/master/Supplements/Supplement6A.pdf) and [6B (Oral)](https://github.com/begavett/CoCA/blob/master/Supplements/Supplement6B.pdf) and stopwatch

If administering both Written and Oral versions, administer the written version (Supplement 6A) before the Oral version (Supplement 6B).

### Written version

*Here,* (point to the key), *you see two rows; there are symbols in the top row and the bottom row consists of corresponding numbers. Each symbol has its own number.*

*Now, here* (point), *you see rows that have symbols in the top part and are empty in the bottom part. I want you fill in the empty boxes with their corresponding numbers.*

*Look at the first symbol* (point to first symbol on Sample). *I look at this symbol, then look at the key. The symbol matches the number 3. So I go ahead and put that in the empty box below the symbol.* (write 3 below the first symbol on the Sample)

*Look at the next symbol* (point to the second symbol on Sample). *I look at this symbol, then look at the key. The symbol matches the number 7. So I go ahead and put that in the empty box below the symbol.* (write 7 below the second symbol on the Sample)
 
*Look at the next symbol* (point to the third symbol on Sample). *I look at this symbol, then look at the key. The symbol matches the number 9. So I go ahead and put that in the empty box below the symbol.* (write 9 below the third symbol on the Sample)

*Now, I want to you to fill in the boxes until this heavily shaded line.*

*Now, I am going to give you 30 seconds to fill in as many boxes as you can. Begin here* (point) *and fill in as many boxes as possible, without skipping any. When you finish one row move on to the next row. Continue working until I ask you to stop. Ready? Go!*

### Oral Version

*Now, we are going to do something the same thing a little differently. I want you verbally state the numbers that match the presented symbols.*

*For example, look at the first symbol* (point to first symbol on Sample). *I look at this symbol, then look at the key. The symbol matches the number 3. So I want you to say 3.*

*Now, I am going to give you 30 seconds to state as many numbers matching the presented symbols as fast as you can. When you finish one row move on to the next row. Continue working until I ask you to stop. Ready? Go!*
